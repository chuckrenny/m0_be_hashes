# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
1. I've had previous experience with object manipulation in javascript so I feel comfortable with hashes. Thankfully this was mostly review.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
1. Note-taking is going swell. I find it most helpful to take notes first then go back and fill in thenotes with any relevant information I may either find online or in class.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
1. I first try to solve the problem in code on my own and with notes. Then I ask questions to nudge myself in the direction that I think can lead me to a solution.
